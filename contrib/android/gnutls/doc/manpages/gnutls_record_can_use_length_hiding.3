.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns true (1) if the current session supports length\-hiding
padding, false (0) if the current session does not. Returns
a negative value in case of error.
If the session supports length\-hiding padding, you can
invoke \fBgnutls_range_send_message()\fP to send a message whose
length is hidden in the given range. If the session does not
support length hiding padding, you can use the standard
\fBgnutls_record_send()\fP function, or \fBgnutls_range_send_message()\fP
making sure that the range is the same as the length of the
message you are trying to send.
