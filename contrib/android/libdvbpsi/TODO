TODO:
- Document howto change "Old API" to "New API"
- use dvbpsi_NewBAT/CAT/XXX() and dvbpsi_DeleteXXX() in dvbpsi_GatherXXXSections() functions
- fix demux_subdec_t and dvbpsi_decoder_t discrepancy
- require one handle to libdvbpsi and chain table decoders
- (optional) highlevel TS handler functions (eg: dvbpsi_ts_* )
- (optional) make use of BitStream header files to minimize rework
- find solution for SIS descriptors decoding, since they use the same tag-id as PMT descriptors do.
  Separate DVB/ITU and SCTE descriptors in separate directories.
  For instance: descriptors/dvb
                descriptors/scte
- write SIS Command Decoders

ENHANCEMENTS:
- dvbinfo: record/caculate distance between audio and video in bytes AND time
- dvbinfo: new modular design
     input (tcp,udp,file) -> buffer -> analysis -> output (tcp,udp,file)
                                          |-> event log -> write capture info to file (date, pkt, pid, cc, bytes pos in file): think of wireshark mainscreen
- dvbinfo-gui: capture (MPEG-TS) file -> generate graphs -> PSI (pat/pmt/cat) interval (new versions, repeated version)
               capture event log      ->                 -> packer arrival times/diffs (VBR/CBR), split by ES (each ES other color)
                                                         -> stream/packet details

DECISION:
- dvbpsi_descriptor_t decoder/encoder functions do not use dvbpsi_t pointer and message callback on error NULL is returned
